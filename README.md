## Design Philosophy


This ruleset is designed with two major goals in mind:

1.  To create a world which allows the standard D&D ruleset to be set in a post-modern setting;
1.  To add a number of custom mechanics to the game to enhance the depth of the player experience.

## Summary of Changes

* Custom post-apocalyptic gritty fantasy setting
* Adds a Grand Strategy layer to the game
  * Computer program to help DM and player manage the world map
* Monstrosity mechanic
* Rules for modern firearms
* Races, Subclasses, and Monsters designed to make use of the Modern and Eldritch setting


## Setting Description
*Shadows dance in the alleyways, a strangely viscous consistency to their movements. Small, skittering horrors creep along the ceilings, frightening children and filling the air with their chittering calls. Bands of cultist marauders stalk the streets, having abandoned their own kind in favor of a new, more terrible overlord. This is Boston 30--, a thousand years after the Awakening.*

*Not so far from today, magic was reawakened in the world. Eldritch horrors long sleeping awoke, and with their reemergence came an explosion of magical energy. Humanity was transformed -- some of them literally. Certain bloodlines, their Eldritch past long forgotten, woke to a transformed existence. The Eldritch calling boils in their blood, and their bodies warped and changed into different magical races.*

*Even those whose bodies remained unchanged were not left entirely whole. Those who were particularly magically sensitive developed strange new abilities which we might call magic. Some used these powers for good, and others for evil. Before society could fully adapt to these changes, the Invasion began.*

*It started with small things. People reported strange sounds down alleyways, sightings of moving shadows in the daylight. Then, people started to go missing, swallowed up by the darkness of untold horrors. We ignored these warnings for what they were, and continued to bicker amongst ourselves like spoiled children. We should have known it was going to get worse.*

*Comets began to land, all around the world, harbingers of our destruction. These strange new metals seemed to shift between realities, emitting an entirely new kind of energy. Wherever they landed, a stream of dark horrors streamed forth, an incessant wave of true terror. It was over in days, but lasted much longer.*

*All organized resistance quickly crumbled before the repeated and powerful assaults of the Eldritch horde. Even as reports began to trickle in, tall tales of ordinary men and women turned into monstrous things, we were forced beneath the streets. Concealed by the same shadows which were once the devilish highway of our adversaries, we waited, and rebuilt what we could. In time, scouts sent to the surface began to return unmenaced, and we began to believe the world above could be ours once again. The Outer Gods returned to their slumber; we must take this chance to reclaim a foothold above, and drive what horrors remain back to their unholy residence.*

#### The MBTA


"Charlie on the MTA" / "Winter Happens"

The MBTA, Boston's public transit system in the Old Days, still gets people where they need to go. Most of the time. Brave adventurers navigate the dark and treacherous linkages between small beacons of civilization established at many of the stops. These tend to be smaller settlements, usually little more than waypoints en route to the remaining large settlements; but as with other dark places in the city, the shadows seem to move on their own and the sounds of otherworldly corruption echo down abandoned, crumbling concrete halls.

## Mechanics


### Monstrosity


#### Overview

Monstrosity is a measure of how much a character's Eldritch Nature has been empowered. Certain classes and races are more affected by this rating than others, but in general the rules for Monstrosity are as follows:

At 0% Monstrosity, the character's rational mind is entirely under their own control. Their Eldritch features are barely visible and easily concealable for most Races. The character does not receive any bonuses or penalties.

At ~25% Monstrosity, the character's relationship with reality begins to fray slightly. The character receives +1 to their primary attribute. This comes at the expense of their sanity, however; at this point, your character's Eldritch qualities become more emphasized and your personality is slightly altered in the direction of your Eldritch heritage (i.e. Orcs become more aggressive, Elves become more reclusive, etc.). The character receives -1 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives a Class-based benefit and drawback.

At ~50% Monstrosity, the character's Eldritch side begins to assert itself more frequently. Certain locations and interactions may cause this condition to flare up. If this occurs, the player must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12) or be compelled to take an Eldritch action of the DM's discretion. The character receives +2 to their primary attribute and -2 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives a Class-based benefit and drawback.

At ~75% Monstrosity, the character's Eldritch side is a constant presence. The character's Eldritch qualities are fully emphasized and affect NPC interactions. In addition to location and interaction checks, the player must make a Wisdom saving throw at every long rest (DC 13). If the player does not succeed, their Monstrosity increases by 5%. The character receives +3 to their primary attribute and -3 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives a Race-based benefit and drawback. Characters gain weakness to damage types based on their class.

At 100% Monstrosity, the character's Eldritch side has fully manifested. The character receives +4 to their primary attribute and -4 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives an extremely powerful ability based on their Race. Using this ability sets Monstrosity to 50%, deals 2d10 damage to the character, and they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 16). If the character fails this throw, they are knocked Unconscious.


#### Managing Monstrosity

Monstrosity can be increased by:



*   Being in an area with high Eldritch energy for extended periods of time
*   Certain enemy attacks
*   Certain magical items
*   Consuming or otherwise using Eldritch-charged items

Monstrosity can be decreased by:



*   Magical rituals
*   Certain magical items
*   Brewed remedies

## Ruler Archetypes
As you gain power and influence, you will start to be able to affect change in the settlements you rule. Starting at 5th level, you may choose one of these Ruler archetypes, each of which has specific benefits and drawbacks to fit your playstyle.

### Despot

### Monarch

### Populist

### Traditionalist

### Zealot

### Democrat

## Races

### Android

#### Flavor
"Does this unit have a soul?"


#### About
Incredibly sophisticated in design, yet imperfect, the Android is a relic of a bygone era. Incredibly rare and hunted for their advanced technological parts, their silicon hearts beat in perfect time -- when they're fully charged. Androids must maintain Power, a rare luxury in the sundered world. Lucky Androids carry their own means of generating power through renewable means, but older models are forced to find more creative solutions.

#### Ability Scores
Attribute  | Bonus
--|--
STR  | +1
INT  |  +2
WIS  |  -1  
CHA  |  -1


#### Power
Androids have the unenviable task of maintaining Power as well as the standard unit hitpoints. In the case of the Android, Power represents the unit's ability to maintain its internal functions, whereas HP represent the physical condition of its body. This means that in certain cases an Android whose body has been destroyed may be loaded into a different body, provided its Power is maintained. This has been known to be a traumatic experience for synthetics and can have unpredictable effects on the integrity of their personality.

When creating an Android, you have to determine what method of power generation it uses. You may select any of the first-tier methods unanimously, or ask your DM about starting with a higher tier generator.

##### Tier 1 Power Generators


##### Tier 2 Power Generators


##### Tier 3 Power Generators


### Saerun


### Symbiote
Not quite human, not quite creature; a haunting portrait of a transformation half-done, a being trapped between equally hellish worlds. The Symbiote is a hellish, unfinished mixture of beings Eldritch and humanoid. A Symbiote is formed out of a failed Eldritch possession, and as such is a new creature forged from pieces of its constituent parties.

*"So it's done then?" Archon growled, rolling his shoulders as he tried to get used to the unsettling feeling of something crawling just beneath the skin. The creature's response reverberated in his head, less an actual response than a wave of emotion, a sense of dark satisfaction.*  

*"I'll take that as a yes."*  

*Archon flexed again and watched as the creature's terribly jagged, insect-like forearm materialized from the shadows above his shoulder, hanging down like some abominable shoulder piece. A grin stretched across his face, unnatural.*

*"Well then. Let's tear some shit up."*  

*A satisfied, unearthly growl precipitated Archon's purposeful stride back towards the House of Sorrows.*

##### About
Eldritch Hosts are those whose connection with nature extends to even those most unnatural creatures who roam the streets of Awakened Boston. In exchange for the Eldritch creature's assistance in battle and otherwise, the Host provides its flesh and energy as sustenance. This is not always an easy partnership, nor always a willing one, but it is nevertheless powerful. Eldritch creatures' motivations are as diverse as they are powerful. Perhaps a Lawful Good Host contracts with a creature determined to defeat the Eldritch legions, or a Chaotic Evil host shares a love of destruction with her familiar.

##### Eldritch Affinity
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain special affinity with an Eldritch entity of your choice (at the GM's discretion). You immediately gain a number of Eldritch Energy points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can spend Eldritch Energy to perform a variety of Eldritch abilities.  

**Every time you score a critical hit while in combat, you immediately regain a point of Eldritch Energy.**  
**If you kill someone with an Eldritch ability, roll 1d8. If it is greater than 6, regain a point of Eldritch Energy as well as 5 additional points of Monstrosity.**


##### Eldritch Assistance
A contract sealed is a contract kept. As a bonus action, you may spend a point of Eldritch Energy to summon the assistance of the Eldritch creature you are currently hosting. Its assistance allows you to add an additional 1d6 damage to a successful attack. This number increases by 1d10 every two levels in Eldritch Host you gain above 3rd level. The damage type is determined by the Eldritch creature you have contracted with. Using this ability also increases your Monstrosity by 5 points.

##### Eldritch Guardian
A shared body, a shared need to survive. Starting at 5th level, you may spend a point of Eldritch Energy as a reaction to reduce incoming damage by half. At 9th level, your Eldritch companion may make an additional reaction. This reaction cannot be spent on this ability.


##### Manifest
There, in the shadows - a shape, moving on its own! Starting at 7th level, you may spend two points of Eldritch Energy to summon a spectral version of your Eldritch familiar. This specter has 5d6 HP and has a reduced set of abilities from its corporeal version. The specter lasts until the caster's concentration is broken, the spell is ended by the caster, or after an hour, whichever comes first.

At 17th level, this spell can be cast as a bonus action and no longer requires concentration to maintain. In addition, the specter gains an additional 4d6 HP and has full access to its abilities.


##### Eldritch Form
A most terrible sight - twisted and snarling, abomination in two worlds. Starting at 11th level, you may spend two Eldritch Energy points to use an action to meld your form with your Eldritch familiar's. You immediately heal 4d6 hit points and gain advantage on your next attack. A series of other effects occur based on the selected familiar, detailed in the Monsters section of this expansion. Your Monstrosity increases by 30 points immediately when you use this ability and is reduced by 10 when the form ends.

At 15th level, this transformation becomes faster and may be performed as a bonus action.




### Rogue

#### Shadow Tinkerer

##### Flavor
*"Most folks," Arn-Tholn began, twirling a grease-blackened wrench around one long, elvish finger, "don't think too hard about what goes into what they use." Deft hands worked faster than she spoke, pushing tiny metal bits into exactly the right place. Cover, secure, test. A little to the left. Orn watched as she rolled to the other corner of her tiny workshop, fishing for just the right esoteric part to make complete her invention.*  

*"Is that so? And you're telling me you're the sort to do that kind of thinking." Orn rumbled, the strange consonants of the Common dialect rolling uncomfortably over a tongue used to the simple beauty of the Orcish language. The elf clicked her tongue in a sort of annoyed confirmation, delving deeper into the mechanics of the small disk she was working on.*  

*"That would be my point, indeed." With a final click and a satisfied sound, she rolled over to her large guest. Handing the disk to him, she waved the same wrench over towards the door. "Try that out. You're used to throwing, right? See if you can get it into that dumpster." Orn hefted the small thing, dwarfed by his hand, and raised an eyebrow.*

*"This thing is supposed to get me in to the grand bank?"*

*"Yes. Now throw!" She gestured again. Skeptical, Orn did as she asked, throwing the disk in a nice arc towards the dumpster about a hundred feet away.*

*Even at such a distance, he could feel the incredible heat of the explosion as if it were right in front of him. The dumpster erupted in a massive fireball, making him glad that they were in an abandoned part of town. He turned to the now-smiling elf, her eyes glittering with amusement -- and something darker -- as she held another of the devices out to him.*

*"Now, I believe we were about to discuss payment?"*

##### About
Shadow Tinkerers forget more about gadgetry than most folks will ever learn. These masters of gears and pulleys hit hard using traps, gadgets, and restored artifacts of the Old World. Whether it's carefully sabotaging a shipment of goods or finding just the right time to incapacitate an enemy, the Shadow Tinkerer is a force to be reckoned with.

##### Tinkerer
Starting when you assume this archetype at 3rd level, you may spend a short rest Tinkering with a weapon or item in your possession. The die to roll, and the outcome it results in, are detailed in the table below.


| Type of Item      | Die to Roll | On Success                                                   | On Failure                        |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Nonmagical Weapon | d6          | 4-6: add your Proficiency modifier to hit for next encounter | 1: -2 to hit for next encounter   |
| Magical Weapon    | d8          | 5-8: add your Proficiency modifier to hit for next encounter | 1-2: -2 to hit for next encounter |

##### Gadgeteer
Starting at 3rd level, you may spend a short rest constructing a Trap or repairing a Gadget. You also gain one Uncommon or Common Gadget selected from the table located in the Items section of this expansion.


##### One with the Shadows
Starting at 5th level, you may use this ability once per short rest to blend into the shadows around you. You gain advantage on Stealth rolls against creatures without dark vision and gain an additional 10 ft of movement speed. At 14th level this ability works against creatures with dark vision as well.

At 7th level you may make a short range teleport between shadowed areas no more than 20 feet apart. At 12th level this range increases to 40 feet.


##### Mechanically Inclined
Starting at 3rd level, you immediately gain knowledge of a school of Mechanical Workings chosen from the table below. You may wield any weapon from that school proficiently and gain advantage on checks involving that particular school of knowledge.

School  | Related Ability Score  | Example Technologies

##### About
Unwilling warrior or bloodthirsty vanguard, the Eldritch Warlock has contracted with those most powerful and terrible of creatures -- the Old Gods, harbingers of great doom and leaders of the Eldritch Invasion. Whether through unworldly guile or hapless foolishness, these warlocks exchange something of mortal value to gain favor with an Old God. They make fearsome allies and formidable foes, although their allegiance may be somewhat suspect - as no one, least of all the warlock, knows when their terrible master may call upon them for some unspeakable act.

*"No!" A bottle of some putrid-looking liquid crashed against the corrugated metal of the shed's walls, the shards falling into a scattered heap onto the dusty wooden floor. The brownish-green fluid oozed down the wall slowly, as if reluctant to meet the floor.*

*"It's wrong! It's all wrong!" Atsor the Foresworn was not a patient man. A brilliant man, perhaps the smartest elf in the city, but not patient. Cursed with genius enough to set goals but insufficient to accomplish them, his assistants knew to avoid the lab when his shouts of inchoate rage and the sounds of bottles breaking disrupted the cool stillness of an unscrupulous evening.*

*"There must be something...something I'm missing..." Half-mad with frustration and the rancor of science gone awry, Atsor paged furiously through the alchemic texts of his forebears, searching for his mistake. The crazed mumblings of a corrupted genius in this strange and dangerous new world often attract the attention of otherworldly and dangerous creatures, willing to exchange unsavory knowledge for sanguine sacrifice. So it was this night, with this elven miscreant.*

*A drop of liquid darkness welled up from the spine of the text, slithering its unholy way towards aged, trembling fingers. "What are you, then?" the alchemist squawked, his curiosity overriding the sense of dread welling up in his most primal being. "Come to laugh at an old fool?"*

*The darkness seemed to shake its head, oozing away through the pages. The scientist flipped carefully through the pages, coming to rest where the darkness had coiled itself, like some terrible feline caricature, around a series of arcane symbols. Atsor grumbled, turning away with a huff. "Damnable creature, I've tried this already! The mixture remains unstable, it requires some sort of..." A sizzling sound broke through his protestations. He turned back to the book to see the darkness slithering away, off the table and into the shadows. He approached the table cautiously to see an addition to the symbols burned onto the page, smoke still rising from its edges.*

*"Yes...yes, of course! How could I not have seen it before? The mixture requires something...otherworldly." The alchemist turned to the shadows, where he could swear an eye peered out at him. Ecstatic with the sensation of the nearness of discovery, the foolish genius extended his hands in supplication. The darkness was all too happy to oblige.*

*The next day, Ro'enthop fell to an onslaught from within. Survivors tell of a crazed laugh, a lab coat streaked with an oily blackness, and an elf whose very being sang with unholy power.*



##### About
The Eldritch Alchemist is a Wizard who, through careful study or reckless contract, has developed an acute understanding of the otherworldly creatures which haunt the streets. Through careful brewing of potions and Elixirs, as well as the preparation of powerful spells, these practitioners of magic are often obsessed with knowledge acquisition and will do almost anything to acquire it. Only the most steadfast of Eldritch Alchemists is able to resist the tantalizing whispers of darkest knowledge; those who do not often fall prey to the unholy machinations of creatures who live far beyond the flickering pale light of this reality.

##### Dark Bargain
You immediately gain a number of Eldritch Knowledge points equal to your Intelligence modifier. You gain an additional point of Knowledge for every two levels you gain above 3 in Eldritch Alchemist. You may spend a short rest to recover 1d4 / 2 Knowledge at the expense of 2d10 Monstrosity, or regain Knowledge equal to half your maximum Secrets with a long rest.


##### Eldritch Alchemy
You immediately gain the ability to brew Common Potions using standard materials as well as first-level Elixirs. Potions you brew and Elixirs you make have a 1d4 chance to be more powerful than the standard version of the potion (at the discretion of the DM). At 7th level you may brew second-level Elixirs and Uncommon Potions. At 13th level you may brew third-level Elixirs. At 15th level you may brew Rare Potions. At 19th level you may brew Legendary Potions.

You may also modify a potion or Elixir to be a Splash Potion. These are throwable items whose primary attribute is Wisdom. The throwables have a 30/60 ft range with a 10 foot circular effect radius.

You may amplify your concoctions using Eldritch Essence. To do so, gain 1d10 Monstrosity to summon Eldritch Essence or harvest it from the world. Use the below table to determine the effect it has on the concoction.

d6 | Effect
---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1  | The blast radius of this potion is doubled.
2  | Add 2d4 to the effect of this potion.
3  | The effect of this potion is lowered by 1d4.
4  | The duration of this potion is doubled.
5  | The user of this potion takes 1d6 damage upon use.
6  | The user of the potion gains advantage on saving throws for the duration of the potion.


##### Knowledge is Power
You may spend a point of Knowledge to make a psychic attack against a creature of your choice. This attack does 2d6 damage per point of Knowledge spent and cannot be blocked. No more than two points of Knowledge may be used for this ability at a time. If the target is killed by this attack, immediately regain a point of Knowledge.

##### Whispers of Madness
At 9th level, you begin to understand the maddening nature of universal truth. You may spend your Knowledge to attempt to drive a creature Mad. This attack does 1d6 damage per point of Knowledge spent. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 + (Knowledge * 2)) or be Enraged. The creature remains Enraged for ten minutes or until the caster loses concentration.

##### Darkness Beckons
At 12th level, you realize that what you know can be used to turn others to your cause. You may spend your Knowledge to attempt to control a creature. This attack does 3d6 damage per point of Knowledge spent. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15 + (Knowledge)) or fall under your control. The creature remains under your control for (Knowledge * 5) minutes or until the caster releases them.

Stun Gauntlet | An artifact from the old world that still sparks with condensed lightning. Melee unarmed assist, 2d6 lightning damage | +2     | Constitution (8 + Proficiency) or be Stunned | 1x Gauntlet<br>2x Electrical coils<br>1x Battery | Uncommon | 300 GP      | Requires the "Dangerous Equipment" Feat to wield proficiently
Two-Way Radio | With this item, you can transmit or receive a message out over the airwaves to anyone using a radio within 5 miles. Because anyone with a radio can receive these messages, different factions have created increasingly complex codes to mask their messages leading to a continuous arms race between codetalkers and codebreakers. | | | 1x Antenna<br> 1x Battery | Common | 50 GP |
Entangled Speakers | These speakers glow red with eldritch energy, and they each constantly emit the sounds surrounding their companion speaker. The devices emit the sounds at the exact same volume as they reach the companion device, and there is no apparent way to turn them off short of breaking them. Notably, there is no distance at which this communication is severed, and they can transmit even between planes. | | | 2x Speakers<br>2x Eldritch Crystals | Rare | 1000 GP | If the two speakers are brought within a foot of each other, a dangerous feedback loop is initiated which releases 2d10 force damage to everyone within 15 feet and destroys the speakers.
Form Stealer | With this device, the user can take a photo of a subject, store it, and at any later time release an eldritch apparition mimicking the subject's appearance and voice. This apparition will take verbal orders from the user and can speak, move, and interact with electronics, however they cannot interact with any physical object. The user can use the camera's display to watch through the eyes of the apparition, and at any point pressing the power button on the camera will cause the apparition to dissipate. | | Perception Check DC 17 | 1x Camera<br>1x Projector<br>4x Eldritch Crystal | | | Note that while the eldritch spirit manifesting the apparition is compelled to follow the orders of the user, when confronted with situations beyond the scope of its orders the spirit will simply choose its course of action according to its whims.
Night Vision Goggles | Wearing these goggles provides the user with darkvision out to 30 feet. | | | 2x Camera<br>1x Circuitry | Common | 50 GP|  



### Traps
In addition to the traps outlined in the standard D&D5e ruleset, these traps may be employed in the world or constructed by players.

### Grand Strategy


#### Example Scenario: Units, Readiness, War
Player 1 (P1) controls a Settlement (S1) and is considering making a large-scale attack against a Cthulhu Settlement (C1). There is another enemy faction nearby also warring with Cthulhu, the Leviathan Settlement (L1). P1 decides to send a Diplomat to attempt to convince L1 to attack C1. Because the two factions in question are at war, this has a better chance of success than it normally would. Unfortunately the Diplomat rolls poorly and returns at the start of the next turn without success, narrowly avoiding being killed. P1 decides to wait until the attack happens organically, sending a Spy to establish a Listening Post in that Settlement. When the attack is sent out, P1 is ready. In the intervening turns, P1 has spent a good chunk of Population and Wealth on recruiting a large Army. P1 spends half of their Readiness and throws in 10 Wealth to generate a massive Army unit to supplement the Army they've been constructing. P1 carefully lays a path between S1 and C1 so that the Army will arrive shortly after the L1 attack occurs. Knowing that S1 will be vulnerable until the Army returns, P1 asks Player 2 (P2) for reinforcements.

#### Example Scenario: Upgrades, Crises, Secrets
Player 1 (P1) controls a Settlement (S1) which is a Camp about to grow into a Collective. The Upgrade which will enable the transition from Camp to Collective (House) will cost 2 Building Materials and 20 Population worth of production for a full turn. On the turn P1 wanted to make this change, however, a Crisis occurs. 'Crop Failure' causes Farms to produce 2 less Food per turn for 2 turns if not dealt with. There are 2 Standard Options and 1 Special Option to deal with this problem.

* Standard Option 1 is to dedicate Population to harvesting what can be saved. This costs 10 Population and reduces the Effect down to 1 less Food per turn.

* Standard Option 2 is to slash and burn the crop fields, resulting in a one-time loss of 3 Food but preventing any lasting Effect.

This Crisis does not have a full-resolve option.

P1, however, is in luck. Within S1 there is an Arcanist Special Operative (SpecOp A) whose Specialization is Agriculture. This means that the Operative can be deployed for the turn within the Camp to resolve most Agriculture Crises. Larger-scale Crises demand more labor, and the number of Units required to resolve a Crisis in this way scales with Settlement size and Crisis Severity. In general, 10 of a Unit = 1 SpecOp.

P1 deploys SpecOp A to the Camp, and the Crisis is resolved without issue. Before making this change, P1 decides they want to know what their enemy is planning for the next turn. P1 spends a Secret to uncover what the main Cthulhu Settlement (C1) is doing. C1 is planning to mount an attack against a nearby NPC Settlement. P1 doesn't have the resources to help, and so takes the chance to move forward with the Upgrade. At the beginning of the next turn, when Actions are resolved, the Upgrade is complete.

#### Overview

The Grand Strategy mechanics are designed to give players a sense of the larger world and their impact in it, as well as a way to create passive resource generation and add depth to the player experience.

Players take on the role of a town's ruling leadership and make decisions at each Cycle (a length of time at the discretion of the DM). Each Cycle takes the following structure:


1.  Enemy Cycle is resolved
    1.  Missions completed, troops moved, etc etc.
    1.  Enemy turn
        1.  The enemy factions each take their actions based on their level of Secrets. If an Enemy has a high Secrets level, they may make more informed decisions up to and including active sabotage of SpecOp missions.
        1.  Enemy Actions include:
            1.  Fortify
            1.  Expand
            1.  Attack
            1.  Sabotage
            1.  Gather Secrets
1.  Resolve last Cycle's player Actions
    1.  Buildings are constructed, resources are generated, troop movements / battles are resolved, etc.
1.  Players make decisions about how to allocate resources
    1.  Can choose between a variety of buildings/improvements to construct, recruit add'l people, scavenge for food, etc.
    1.  Occasionally there will be a Crisis; this can either be addressed by spending the appropriate amount of a given resource to cull its negative effects or allowed to resolve at detriment to the settlement. Some Crises may also be handled by deploying SpecOps with the necessary skills to handle the Crisis.
1.  SpecOp missions
    1.  These are a variety of special missions which have larger impact on the world and the immediate player experience. These are named NPCS who level up, develop relationships with the players, etc. They are also playable characters in one-shots, depending on player interest (i.e. for a single session players take on the role of those characters assigned to a SpecOps mission with their play determining its success or failure).
    1.  Missions include:
        1.  Diplomatic assignments
        1.  Sabotage assignments
        1.  Clear assignments
        1.  Escort assignments
    1.  SpecOps may also travel alongside the party at an additional food cost.



#### Tactical Map


##### Secrets

Secrets make the world go round. Secrets are a global Resource unique to each Player. Secrets are fairly rare and quite powerful, usually allowing Players to affect the game world or other Players. Many of their uses are informational, but Secrets may also be used to generate resources, sabotage Improvements, etc. etc.


#### Actions
Actions spend Resources to affect change.

#### Protégés

The new world is more dangerous and unforgiving than ever before. Death stalks the unwary, and even veteran adventurers may meet their end. The next generation is your best hope for a lasting legacy.

Players have the option to recruit a custom operative that their main character nurtures as a protégé. On the event of player death, the player may choose to switch to their protégé. At the DM's discretion, they may also switch out characters temporarily without either dying. The protégé gets a bonus specific to the character who mentored them, determined by the DM in consultation with the player.

#### Types of Settlement

Settlements are typically categorized by their population level. Each category has a typical level of Wealth, Prestige, etc. but these are not hard and fast rules. A settlement can transition from one type to the next at the DMs discretion by gaining nearby territory or moving to "greener pastures."


| Settlement Level | Population          | Wealth | Prestige   | Influence  | Despair | Loyalty | Readiness |

Reputation encapsulates the unique passive bonuses a Settlement may acquire over the course of its lifetime. These persist until the Settlement is destroyed. These can be created by player action in association with the Settlement or by the DM in accordance with the Settlement's history of actions.

Example:

**Southern Hospitality**: This Settlement is renowned for being welcoming to newcomers. Those who're polite, that is. Effect: Population increase is multiplied by 1.5. The calculation to increase Food costs is reduced by .25.

**Wary**. This Settlement is particularly alert. Readiness reduction is halved (before calculating other effects).

Food               | Food is the most important resource in the new world. Communities without food either dissipate back into the urban aether or turn to a more vicious sort of consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Settlements can build up Food storage up to a ceiling equal to the current Population / 2 (can be raised by Improvements).                                                           | One point of Food will feed 10 Population for one Cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Without a steady supply of water, communities evaporate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Settlements can build up Water stockpiles up to a ceiling equal to the current Population / 4 (can be raised by Improvements).                                                       | One point of Water will slake the thirst of 10 Population for one Cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
Power              | Electrical things require Power to run. Electricity may bring machines long dead back to life, but it is not the only sort of power in this world -- and by no means the most powerful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Settlements can build up Energy stockpiles up to a ceiling equal to the current Population / 50 (can be raised by Improvements).                                                     | One point of Power will keep the lights on for 1 Machine for one Cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
Population         | Population is a measure of the total number of people living in a given settlement. Given a steady supply of food, the population score will slowly increase on its own up to a maximum determined by the Settlement Type.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                      | Population is assigned to a variety of tasks at each Cycle to generate resources and construct Improvements. Food cost per Cycle is equal to Population / 10 rounded down.                                                                                                                                      | Certain events may also cause Population to rise or drop.
Arcane Materials   | Arcane Materials represent the magical materials a Settlement has in their stockpiles. Crystals, arcane tomes, and other arcane materials fall under this category. At the DM's discretion these resources can be tracked with more granularity, or for ease of use the general "Arcane Materials" category can be used.                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                      | It can be generated actively by SpecOp missions or by assigning Population to scavenge in certain locations. It can be generated passively by certain Improvements or Trade Routes.                                                                                                                             | Each point of AM is treated as two points of Wealth for purposes of calculating attack chance.
Building Materials | Building Materials represent the physical materials a Settlement has in their stockpiles. Timber, stone, metals, etc. all fall under this category. At the DM's discretion these resources can be tracked with more granularity, or for ease of use the simple "building materials" category can be used.                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                      | It can be generated actively by SpecOp missions or by assigning Population to scavenging. It can be generated passively by certain Improvements or Trade Routes.                                                                                                                                                | Each point of BM is treated as a point of wealth for purposes of calculating attack chance.
Wealth             | Wealth is a measure of how much the Settlement is worth. This means both liquid wealth (coin, tools, etc) and natural resources (access to water, strategic importance, etc). Wealth correlates directly to the frequency with which attacks are made against the Settlement, as well as the amount of Influence it generates.                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | For reference, wealth is about 1/10 of a Settlement's wealth in GP. So a Settlement with a wealth of 1 has about 10 GP across its population, whether in liquid cash, items, or Improvements.
Prestige           | Prestige measures how well-known the Settlement is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A Prestigious Settlement has around 70 Prestige. An unprestigious Settlement has around 10 Prestige.                                                                                 | A highly Prestigious Settlement will attract more Population, increase in Wealth more quickly, and draw more powerful SpecOps to the area for recruitment - but will also increase the chance that bandits will attack.                                                                                         |
Influence          | Influence measures how important the Settlement is in the political spheres of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | An Influential Settlement has about 70 Influence. A less Influential Settlement has around 10 Influence.                                                                             | A highly Influential Settlement will be able to Expand more easily, forge more trade routes, and influence the goings-on in other Settlements. Influence also reduces the cost of recruiting Spies and Mercenaries.                                                                                             |
Despair            | When the shambling forces of madness have come into the world from a slumber of aeons, there can be no question of hope, only despair. Despair measures the grip of madness on the colony, and directly influences almost everything about a settlement's operation.                                                                                                                                                                     | Despair can be reduced by Diplomatic missions, purchasing luxury goods, or by successful defense. Despair is increased by successful enemy attacks, food shortages, or world events. | For each level of Despair up to five, Readiness drops by 5% and Loyalty by 2%. Every time Despair increases there is a chance for a Crisis to occur; every time it drops there is a chance for a Respite to occur. Certain buildings and improvements are unlocked / only operate at certain levels of Despair. | Despair scales linearly from 0 to 5. A Desperate Settlement is at 5; a Hopeful Settlement is at 0.
Loyalty            | Loyalty is a measure of a Settlement's allegiance to its leaders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Loyalty steadily increases when food supplies are adequate and Wealth remains above a certain threshold determined by the size of the Settlement.                                    | Settlements with high Loyalty are less likely to generate leadership Crises and will be more willing to give players resources; settlements with low Loyalty are less likely to help the player and will switch allegiance more easily.                                                                         | A Settlement is considered Loyal if its Loyalty is above 70%; the DC for a village to turn drops from DC20 by 1 for every 5% drop below 70% down to 40% Loyalty (DC 14). Below 40% Loyalty, a Settlement is considered Disloyal and the DC for it to turn on the players is at the DM's discretion.
Readiness          | Readiness is a measure of a Settlement's ability to respond quickly to attacks and other events. The Readiness percentage of a town is multiplied by the population to determine the size of its defense force in the event of a surprise attack. Readiness also determines the likelihood of discovering a Sabotage mission in the city. Finally, Readiness determines the size of the attacking force which can be mustered instantly. | Readiness is a percentage value from 0% to 100%. Readiness is reduced by 1% for every Population increase.                                                                           | Readiness plus 1% per 2 wealth spent is multiplied by population to muster an attack force. Defensive readiness is reduced by the amount of readiness spent to form the attacking Unit.                                                                                                                         | Readiness can be increased by assigning Population to tasks or by player action. Certain SpecOp missions will also cause Readiness to increase or decrease. Readiness decreases at a steady rate down to a floor determined by the individual Settlement. This rate of decay can be lessened by certain Improvements.
Defense            | Defense is a measure of a Settlement's passive ability to defend itself - fortifications, preparation, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                      | This number is added to a Settlement's Readiness when calculating the outcome of defending an attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
