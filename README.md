# Ruleset

This project has been split into two repositories: one for the ruleset, and one for what will ultimately be a tool which is used to help manage the more unwieldy customizations in the ruleset. The ruleset repo can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Noah-Houghton/Eldritch-Apocalypse-Ruleset>Eldritch Apocalypse Ruleset</a>. The ruleset is maintained in Overleaf, with the pdf currently on the repo being updated with every major revision to the ruleset.
