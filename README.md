## Summary of Changes

This ruleset is designed with two major goals in mind:



1.  To create a world which allows the standard D&D ruleset to be set in a post-modern setting;
1.  To add a number of custom mechanics to the game to enhance the depth of the player experience.


## Mechanics


### Grand Strategy


#### Example Scenario: Units, Readiness, War
Player 1 (P1) controls a Settlement (S1) and is considering making a large-scale attack against a Cthulhu Settlement (C1). There is another enemy faction nearby also warring with Cthulhu, the Leviathan Settlement (L1). P1 decides to send a Diplomat SpecOp to attempt to convince L1 to attack C1. Because the two factions in question are at war, this has a better chance of success than it normally would. Unfortunately the SpecOp rolls poorly and returns at the start of the next turn without success, narrowly avoiding being killed. P1 decides to wait until the attack happens organically, sending a Spy to establish a Listening Post in that Settlement. When the attack is sent out, P1 is ready. In the intervening terms, P1 has spent a good chunk of Population on increasing Readiness and Wealth. P1 spends half of their Readiness and throws in 10 Wealth to generate a massive Army unit. P1 carefully lays a path between S1 and C1 so that the Army will arrive shortly after the L1 attack occurs. Knowing that S1 will be vulnerable until the Army returns, P1 asks Player 2 (P2) for reinforcements.

#### Example Scenario: Upgrades, Crises, Secrets
Player 1 (P1) controls a Settlement (S1) which is a Camp about to grow into a Collective. The Upgrade which will enable the transition from Camp to Collective (House) will cost 2 Building Materials and 20 Population worth of production for a full turn. On the turn P1 wanted to make this change, however, a Crisis occurs. 'Crop Failure' causes Farms to produce 2 less Food per turn for 2 turns if not dealt with. There are 2 Standard Options and 1 Special Option to deal with this problem.

* Standard Option 1 is to dedicate Population to harvesting what can be saved. This costs 10 Population and reduces the Effect down to 1 less Food per turn.

* Standard Option 2 is to slash and burn the crop fields, resulting in a one-time loss of 3 Food but preventing any lasting Effect.

This Crisis does not have a full-resolve option.

P1, however, is in luck. Within S1 there is an Arcanist Special Operative (SpecOp A) whose Specialization is Agriculture. This means that the Operative can be deployed for the turn within the Camp to resolve most Agriculture Crises. Larger-scale Crises demand more labor, and the number of Units required to resolve a Crisis in this way scales with Settlement size and Crisis Severity. In general, 10 of a Unit = 1 SpecOp.

P1 deploys SpecOp A to the Camp, and the Crisis is resolved without issue. Before making this change, P1 decides they want to know what their enemy is planning for the next turn. P1 spends a Secret to uncover what the main Cthulhu Settlement (C1) is doing. C1 is planning to mount an attack against a nearby NPC Settlement. P1 doesn't have the resources to help, and so takes the chance to move forward with the Upgrade. At the beginning of the next turn, when Actions are resolved, the Upgrade is complete.

#### Overview

The Grand Strategy mechanics are designed to give players a sense of the larger world and their impact in it, as well as a way to create passive resource generation and add depth to the player experience.

Players take on the role of a town's ruling leadership and make decisions at each Cycle (a length of time at the discretion of the DM). Each Cycle takes the following structure:

1.  Resolve last Cycle's longterm projects
    1.  Buildings are constructed, resources are generated, troop movements / battles are resolved, etc.
1.  Enemy Cycle is resolved
    1.  Missions completed, troops moved, etc etc.
    1.  Enemy turn
        1.  The enemy factions each take their actions based on their level of Secrets. If an Enemy has a high Secrets level, they may make more informed decisions up to and including active sabotage of SpecOp missions.
        1.  Enemy actions include:
            1.  Fortify
            1.  Expand
            1.  Attack
            1.  Sabotage
            1.  Gather Secrets
1.  Players make decisions about how to allocate resources
    1.  Can choose between a variety of buildings/improvements to construct, recruit add'l people, scavenge for food, etc.
    1.  Occasionally there will be a Crisis; this can either be addressed by spending the appropriate amount of a given resource to cull its negative effects or allowed to resolve at detriment to the settlement. Some Crises may also be handled by deploying SpecOps with the necessary skills to handle the Crisis.
1.  SpecOp missions
    1.  These are a variety of special missions which have larger impact on the world and the immediate player experience. These are named NPCS who level up, develop relationships with the players, etc. They are also playable characters in one-shots, depending on player interest (i.e. for a single session players take on the role of those characters assigned to a SpecOps mission with their play determining its success or failure).
    1.  Missions include:
        1.  Diplomatic assignments
        1.  Sabotage assignments
        1.  Clear assignments
        1.  Escort assignments
    1.  SpecOps may also travel alongside the party at an additional food cost.



#### Tactical Map


##### Secrets

Secrets make the world go round. Spend secrets on the world map to reduce the difficulty of SpecOps missions, procure additional Settlement resources, or Sabotage enemy actions.


#### Actions


##### Enemy


##### Player


#### Special Operatives

##### Missions

###### Friendly

###### Enemy



##### Proteges

The new world is more dangerous and unforgiving than ever before. Death is a constant companion to the unwary, and even veteran adventurers may meet their end. The next generation is your best hope for a lasting legacy.

Players have the option to recruit a custom operative that their main character nurtures as a protege. On the event of player death, the player may choose to switch to their protege. At the DM's discretion, they may also switch out characters temporarily without either dying. The protege gets a bonus specific to the character who mentored them, determined by the DM in consultation with the player.


##### Arcanists


##### Soldiers


##### Merchants


##### Diplomats


##### Spies


#### Units

##### Army

##### Trader

##### Supply Caravan

##### Settlers


#### Types of Settlement

Settlements are typically categorized by their population level. Each category has a typical level of Wealth, Prestige, etc. but these are not hard and fast rules. A settlement can transition from one type to the next at the DMs discretion by gaining nearby territory or moving to "greener pastures."


##### Camp

Population: 20-99 (4d20 + 10)

Wealth: 1d4

Prestige: 1d6

Influence: 1d10

Despair: 1d4-1

Loyalty: 4d20

Readiness: 2d20


##### Collective

Population: 100-199 (8d20 + 15)

Wealth: 2d6

Prestige: 1d8

Influence: 1d10 + 1d4

Despair: 1d4-1

Loyalty: 4d20

Readiness: 2d20+5


##### Village

Population: 200-499

Wealth: 2d8

Prestige: 1d10

Influence: 1d10 + 1d6

Despair: 1d4-1

Loyalty: 4d20

Readiness: 2d20+10


##### Town

Population: 500-1000

Wealth: 3d6 + 2

Prestige: 1d12

Influence: 1d10 + 1d8

Despair: 1d4-1

Loyalty: 4d20

Readiness: 2d20+10


##### City

Population:1001-2500+

Wealth: 4d8

Prestige: 1d12 + 1d6

Influence: 1d12 + 1d8

Despair: 1d4-1

Loyalty: 4d20

Readiness: 2d20+10


#### Reputation

Reputation encapsulates the unique passive bonuses a Settlement may acquire over the course of its lifetime. These persist until the Settlement is destroyed. These can be created by player action in association with the Settlement or by the DM in accordance with the Settlement's history of actions.

Example:

**Southern Hospitality**: This Settlement is renowned for being welcoming to newcomers. Those who're polite, that is. Effect: Population increase is multiplied by 1.5. The calculation to increase Food costs is reduced by .25.

**Wary**. This Settlement is particularly alert. Readiness reduction is halved (before calculating other effects).

*   Tiers:
*   Prerequisites:


#### Resources


##### Food

Food is the most important resource in the new world. Communities without food either dissipate back into the urban aether or turn to a more vicious sort of consumption.

Food is an integer value. One point of Food will feed 10 Population for one Cycle. Settlements can build up Food storage up to a ceiling equal to the current Population / 2 (can be raised by Improvements).


##### Water

Water is the lifeblood of a Settlement. Without a steady supply of water, communities evaporate.

Water is an integer value. One point of water will slake the thirst of 10 Population for one Cycle. Settlements can build up Water stockpiles up to a ceiling equal to the current Population / 4 (can be raised by Improvements).


##### Population

Population is a measure of the total number of people living in a given settlement. Given a steady supply of food, the population score will slowly increase on its own up to a maximum determined by the Settlement Type. Population is assigned to a variety of tasks at each Cycle to generate resources and construct Improvements. Certain events may also cause Population to rise or drop.

Population is an integer value. Food cost per Cycle is equal to Population / 10 rounded down. Population directly correlates to the number of people in the Settlement.


##### Arcane Materials

Arcane Materials represent the magical materials a Settlement has in their stockpiles. Crystals, arcane tomes, and other arcane materials fall under this category. At the DM's discretion these resources can be tracked with more granularity, or for ease of use the general "Arcane Materials" category can be used.

AM is an integer value. It can be generated actively by SpecOp missions or by assigning Population to scavenge in certain locations. It can be generated passively by certain Improvements or Trade Routes. Each point of AM is treated as two points of Wealth for purposes of calculating attack chance.


##### Building Materials

Building Materials represent the physical materials a Settlement has in their stockpiles. Timber, stone, metals, etc. all fall under this category. At the DM's discretion these resources can be tracked with more granularity, or for ease of use the simple "building materials" category can be used.

Building Materials is an integer value. It can be generated actively by SpecOp missions or by assigning Population to scavenging. It can be generated passively by certain Improvements or Trade Routes. Each point of BM is treated as a point of wealth for purposes of calculating attack chance.


##### Wealth

Wealth is a measure of how much the Settlement is worth. This means both liquid wealth (coin, tools, etc) and natural resources (access to water, strategic importance, etc). Wealth correlates directly to the frequency with which attacks are made against the Settlement, as well as the amount of Influence it generates

For reference, wealth is about 1/10 of a Settlement's wealth in GP. So a Settlement with a wealth of 1 has about 10 GP across its population, whether in liquid cash, items, or Improvements.


##### Prestige

Prestige measures how well-known the Settlement is. A highly Prestigious Settlement will attract more Population, increase in Wealth more quickly, and draw more powerful SpecOps to the area - but will also increase the Readiness threshold required to guard against attacks.

A Prestigious Settlement has around 70 Prestige. An unprestigious Settlement has around 10 Prestige.


##### Influence

Influence measures how important the Settlement is in the political spheres of the world. A highly Influential Settlement will be able to Expand more easily, forge more trade routes, and influence the goings-on in other Settlements. Influence also reduces the cost of recruiting Spies and Mercenaries.

An Influential Settlement has about 70 Influence. A less Influential Settlement has around 10 Influence.


##### Despair

When the shambling forces of madness have come into the world from a slumber of aeons, there can be no question of hope, only despair. Despair measures the grip of madness on the colony, and directly influences almost everything about a settlement's operation. For each level of Despair up to five, Readiness drops by 5% and Loyalty by 2%. Every time Despair increases there is a chance for a Crisis to occur; every time it drops there is a chance for a Boon to occur. Certain buildings and improvements are unlocked / only operate at certain levels of Despair. Despair can be reduced by Diplomatic missions, purchasing luxury goods, or by successful defense. Despair is increased by successful enemy attacks, food shortages, or world events.

Despair scales linearly from 0 to 5. A Desperate Settlement is at 5; a Hopeful Settlement is at 0.


##### Loyalty

Loyalty is a measure of a Settlement's allegiance to its leaders. Settlements with high Loyalty are less likely to generate leadership Crises and will be more willing to give players resources; settlements with low Loyalty are less likely to help the player and will switch allegiance more easily. Loyalty steadily increases when food supplies are adequate and Wealth remains above a certain threshold determined by the size of the Settlement.

A Settlement is considered Loyal if its Loyalty is above 70%; the DC for a village to turn drops from DC20 by 1 for every 5% drop below 70% down to 40% Loyalty (DC 14). Below 40% Loyalty, a Settlement is considered Disloyal and the DC for it to turn on the players is at the DM's discretion.


##### Readiness

Readiness is a measure of a Settlement's ability to respond quickly to attacks and other events. The Readiness percentage of a town is multiplied by the population to determine the size of its defense force in the event of a surprise attack. Readiness also determines the likelihood of discovering a Sabotage mission in the city. Finally, Readiness determines the size of the attacking force which can be mustered instantly. Readiness plus 1% per 2 wealth spent is multiplied by population to muster an attack force. Defensive readiness is reduced by the amount of readiness spent to form the attacking Unit.

Readiness is a percentage value from 0% to 100%. Readiness is reduced by 1% for every Population increase.

Readiness can be increased by assigning Population to tasks or by player action. Certain SpecOp missions will also cause Readiness to increase or decrease. Readiness decreases at a steady rate down to a floor determined by the individual Settlement. This rate of decay can be lessened by certain Improvements.


#### Defense
Defense is a measure of a Settlement's passive ability to defend itself - fortifications, preparation, etc. This number is added to a Settlement's Readiness when calculating the outcome of defending an attack.


### Firearms


### Monstrosity


#### Overview

Monstrosity is a measure of how much a character's Eldritch Nature has been empowered. Certain classes and races are more affected by this rating than others, but in general the rules for Monstrosity are as follows:

At 0% Monstrosity, the character's rational mind is entirely under their own control. Their Eldritch features are barely visible and easily concealable for most Races. The character does not receive any bonuses or penalties.

At ~25% Monstrosity, the character's relationship with reality begins to fray slightly. The character receives +1 to their primary attribute. This comes at the expense of their sanity, however; at this point, your character's Eldritch qualities become more emphasized and your personality is slightly altered in the direction of your Eldritch heritage (i.e. Orcs become more aggressive, Elves become more reclusive, etc.). The character receives -1 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives a Class-based benefit and drawback.

At ~50% Monstrosity, the character's Eldritch side begins to assert itself more frequently. Certain locations and interactions may cause this condition to flare up. If this occurs, the player must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12) or be compelled to take an Eldritch action of the DM's discretion. The character receives +2 to their primary attribute and -2 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives a Class-based benefit and drawback.

At ~75% Monstrosity, the character's Eldritch side is a constant presence. The character's Eldritch qualities are fully emphasized and affect NPC interactions. In addition to location and interaction checks, the player must make a Wisdom saving throw at every long rest (DC 13). If the player does not succeed, their Monstrosity increases by 5%. The character receives +3 to their primary attribute and -3 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives a Race-based benefit and drawback. Characters gain weakness to damage types based on their class.

At 100% Monstrosity, the character's Eldritch side has fully manifested. The character receives +4 to their primary attribute and -4 to Charisma based checks. The character also receives an extremely powerful ability based on their Race. Using this ability sets Monstrosity to 50%, deals 2d10 damage to the character, and they must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 16). If the character fails this throw, they are knocked Unconscious.


#### Managing Monstrosity

Monstrosity can be increased by:



*   Being in an area with high Eldritch energy for extended periods of time
*   Certain enemy attacks
*   Certain magical items
*   Consuming or otherwise using Eldritch-charged items

Monstrosity can be decreased by:



*   Magical rituals
*   Certain magical items
*   Brewed remedies
