This project was recently converted to Overleaf. It is still in a transitory period, so for now manual updates will be made to this repository until I can synchronize the Overleaf project with a GitHub repository. You can download "Eldritch Apocalypse Ruleset.pdf" to see the most recently updated version of the ruleset, but please be aware that it is very much a work in progress and I am rapidly adding to and refining the document.
